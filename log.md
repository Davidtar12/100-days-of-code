# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of Javascript at Codecademy, mainly basic knowledge on the while do/while loops. Then I created a FCC account and honed it a little

**Thoughts:** I feel Codecademy maybe isn't the best tool to accelerate the learning process. I am considering to start my hour of practice with FCC and then switch a bit to Codecademy.
