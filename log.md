# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of Javascript at Codecademy, mainly basic knowledge on the while do/while loops. Then I created a FCC account and honed it a little

**Thoughts:** I feel Codecademy maybe isn't the best tool to accelerate the learning process. I am considering to start my hour of practice with FreeCodeCamp (FCC) and then switch a bit to Codecademy.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I quit Codecademy as I felt it was inefficient. Then I started the HTML5 curriculum on FreeCodeCamp and it's much more useful and productive. I am having progress on my CatPhotoApp :)

**Thoughts:** Switching to FCC was the best decision. I'm happy I took this step. The whole FCC structure will help my evolution.

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished FCC HTML5 curriculum by honing my CatPhotoApp and by learning CSS basics such as styling RGB colors, margins, padding and boxes. It was quite fun. I will use these skills later on.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with my progress and I'll keep on track

### Day 4: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Bootstrap module and started the jQuery one.

**Thoughts:** I was a bit tired because it's saturday and I coded after meeting some friends, but it was producitve and fun. I just keep doing it and then I feel that I love it

### Day 5: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the jQuery module

**Thoughts:** I liked the jQuery module, the last point (the "animated hinge" addClass feature) was quite funny

### Day 6: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started building my tribute page to Henry David Thoreau based on the look from the Dr. Norman Borlaug's page built by Quincy Larson. I worked for two hours to replace the hour I didn't code yesterday

**Thoughts:** I liked the experience, the best I could do to make it fun whiel challenging was chosing a topic of my own interest
