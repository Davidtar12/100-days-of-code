# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of Javascript at Codecademy, mainly basic knowledge on the while do/while loops. Then I created a FCC account and honed it a little

**Thoughts:** I feel Codecademy maybe isn't the best tool to accelerate the learning process. I am considering to start my hour of practice with FCC and then switch a bit to Codecademy.

**Link to work:** None for today as I didn't start a project at FCC, but tomorrow I'll do it :)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
