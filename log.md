# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit of Javascript at Codecademy, mainly basic knowledge on the while do/while loops. Then I created a FCC account and honed it a little

**Thoughts:** I feel Codecademy maybe isn't the best tool to accelerate the learning process. I am considering to start my hour of practice with FreeCodeCamp (FCC) and then switch a bit to Codecademy.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I quit Codecademy as I felt it was inefficient. Then I started the HTML5 curriculum on FreeCodeCamp and it's much more useful and productive. I am having progress on my CatPhotoApp :)

**Thoughts:** Switching to FCC was the best decision. I'm happy I took this step. The whole FCC structure will help my evolution.

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished FCC HTML5 curriculum by honing my CatPhotoApp and by learning CSS basics such as styling RGB colors, margins, padding and boxes. It was quite fun. I will use these skills later on.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy with my progress and I'll keep on track
